.SH NAME

dhcpy6d - MAC address aware DHCPv6 server

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBdhcpy6d\fP \fIdhcpy6d.conf\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dhcpy6d
is an open source server for DHCPv6, the DHCP protocol for IPv6.

Its development is driven by the need to be able to use the existing
IPv4 infrastructure in coexistence with IPv6.  In a dualstack
scenario, the existing DHCPv4 most probably uses MAC addresses of
clients to identify them.  This is not intended by RFC 3315 for
DHCPv6, but also not forbidden.  Dhcpy6d is able to do so in local
network segments and therefore offers a pragmatical method for
parallel use of DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, because existing client management
solutions could be used further.

.SH OPTIONS

None so far. All configuration is done via the configuration file.

.SH FULL DOCUMENTATION

For now the full documentation is only available online at
